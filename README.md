# CS361-microservice
microservice for my partner to use for CS361

This microservice uses python because there is a rounding function build into python that made this process simple to exicute and shouldn't have any errors. 

It works by taking an imput from the client.py and sending it, through a text file, to Rounding.py. Rounding.py then rounds the number and sends the new number back through the same textfile. 

(if changes need to be made please let me know over teams)
